# SENTI -API
 I designed and implemented a project with the objective of processing and analyzing user-input text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This involved creating an API using Flask in Python to handle user input. The API performed various processing steps such as converting input text to lowercase, lemmatizing the text, removing stop words and punctuation from sentences, and conducting sentiment analysis.  For the sentiment analysis task, I trained machine learning models including Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on appropriate datasets. Among these models, I selected the SVM model as the most suitable for sentiment analysis and integrated it into the API. This allowed the API to classify input text into sentiment categories.  To ensure data persistence, I utilized MySQL as the database management system to store the following components of processed text: the original input text in lowercase, lemmatized text, sentences after removing stop words and punctuation, and the sentiment analysis output. By leveraging the Flask framework, I facilitated user interaction with the API, enabling them to input text and receive processed results.  To enhance security and user control, I implemented user authentication within the project. This feature ensured that only authorized users could access and interact with the API.  The technology stack for this project included Python for programming, Flask for building the API, MySQL for database management, and various NLP libraries to implement text processing and sentiment analysis. The integration of these technologies allowed for efficient text analysis and storage.
